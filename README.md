# Football Analysis

This repository is a personnal sandbox made to make a few football analysis on transfer data. I will also try to build Machine Learning models be able to predict transfer values for football players.

The dataset used in this repository is obtained from TransferMarkt.com and is not contained in this repository for confidentiality reasons. Ask me directly if you want it.

## Requirements

A requirements file is contained and gives you the list of the python packages needed in order to run the different scripts.

## .py files

Python scripts are available in the main folder (football-stats). You can run them by executing : TODO

## .ipynb files

Some .ipynb files are available in this repository in order to quickly visualize the work done in this repo.
